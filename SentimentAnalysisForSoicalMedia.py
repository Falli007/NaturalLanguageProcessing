#Sentiment analysis on social media helps businesses and analysts understand public opinions in real time. 
#In this project, we analyze sentiment in short, informal text like tweets or posts using a pretrained sentiment model.
# I used VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), which is tailored for social media language.

# Install if not already: pip install vaderSentiment

import nltk        # Natural Language Toolkit for text processing
from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer     # For sentiment analysis using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)
 
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')    # Download the VADER lexicon, which is a pre-built sentiment analysis model specifically designed for social media text.
 
# Initialize VADER sentiment analyzer
sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()     # Create an instance of the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
 
# Example social media posts

    "I'm so happy with the new update! ðŸš€ðŸ”¥",

    "Brexit was a terrible decision for the UK. #BrexitFail",
