#Intent recognition is a core component of chatbots that classifies a user‚Äôs input into a predefined intent (e.g., greeting, order_status, cancel_reservation). 
# In this project, I'll demonstrate how to build a simple intent recognition model using Python's scikit-learn library.
# Install if not already: pip install scikit-learn
